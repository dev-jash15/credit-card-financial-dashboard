# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

### Objective
The Credit Card Financial Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI project designed to provide real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends of credit card operations. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card usage and related data effectively.

### Project Features
1. Import Data: Data was imported into a PostgreSQL database.
2. Power BI Connection: Connected Power BI to the PostgreSQL database for seamless data retrieval.
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
4. DAX Queries: Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries to add analytical capabilities.
5. Interactive Dashboards: Created 2 interactive dashboards to visualize important metrics and trends.

### Steps Involved
1. Import Data into PostgreSQL
The credit card transactional data was imported into a PostgreSQL database. This involved:
   1. Setting up the database schema for efficient data storage.
   2. Loading data into PostgreSQL for real-time insights.
2. Connect Power BI to PostgreSQL
   1. Established a connection between Power BI and the PostgreSQL database for seamless data retrieval.
   2. Configured Power BI to auto-refresh, ensuring stakeholders view up-to-date data.
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  1. Applied data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing fields.
  2. Preprocessed data to aggregate weekly metrics, enabling more accurate and efficient reporting.
4. DAX Queries
  1. Created DAX measures for calculating important metrics such as average spend per customer, transaction volume, and customer segmentation.
  2. Developed calculated columns for further analysis.
6. Interactive Dashboards
Developed two interactive dashboards that provided:
   1. Dashboard 1: Overview of credit card operations, including total transactions, total revenue, average spend per transaction, and trends over time.
   2. Dashboard 2: Customer insights, including active customers, transaction frequency, and customer segments based on spending behavior.
